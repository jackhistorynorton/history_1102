	Timelines I Assignment Questions

Answer the questions in complete sentences, please, in a plain text document, saved as .txt or Markdown (.md, .mdown) and submit your answers to the Time I Assignment Submission Folder on D2L. I will refer to the timelines by their common names, that is the PBS, Asia for Educators, World Digital Library (WDL), and Heilbrunn timelines. 


1. Which timeline did you find provided the best information for understanding family life in India? Why?

2. Which timeline did you find graphically most appealing? Why?

3. Which timeline offered the best explanation of why history occurred as it did? Please give a short (one or two sentence) example of how the timeline showed how one event/person/idea led to a second event/person/idea.

4. Asia for Educators includes no primary sources, Heilbrunn and the WDL timelines include many primary sources, and the PBS timeline has mixed some primary sources into many secondary sources. If you wanted to reach a rural Minnesotan taking a college online history course and researching the history of British India, which timeline would you recommend? Why?

5. What do all of these timelines have in common (at least two and no more than four things)?

6. What group or groups of people do these timelines neglect? Such groups may be big or small, significant or not. For example, I found no material specifically about left-handed individuals in any of these timelines. Perhaps silly, but not given the historic [prejudice](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-are-some-people-left-handed-6556937/?no-ist) against lefties.
