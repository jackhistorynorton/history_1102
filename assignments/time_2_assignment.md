theme you've chosen for Tokagawa Japan and Mughal/British India. If your list turns out to have many items for just one are (say six items for India and only one for Japan) you may need to chose a different theme if your first choice isn't broad enough.

**E.** Chose four historical objects from credible websites (such as those above), two from Japan and two from India, that demonstrate at least one comparison and one contrast.

**D.** Build a Knightlab Timeline using your four objects. Name your Timeline the family theme you've chosen. For example: “Selecting a Spouse in Edu Japan and British India). Each item in your timeline should include once sentence that ties your historical objects to the theme, explaining to whoever might look at your timeline how the objects relate to your title.

**F.** Publish your Knightlab Timeline to D2L in the appropriate Discussion.
